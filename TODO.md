// TODO LIST

- Debug why change in WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT, SNAKE_SIZE makes the game unplayable
- Box the snake game (to avoid colliding with text)
- Add AI
- Add two player mode
- Add Timer
- Add playstation controller support
- Rename to underscore notation
- Make a config based on yml
- Turn every pointer into smart pointers
- make my own "pixel class". This might solve the first bullet point issue
